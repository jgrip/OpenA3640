![Render of PCB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgrip/OpenA3640/main/Pics/board.jpg)

This is a clone of the Commodore CPU card made with KiCad, licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

It contains both schematic and PCB layout, based on the original C= schematics.
This PCB has *not* been manufactured and tested but it should work. Should you want to make boards from this it is at your own risk.

The only changes made compared to the original C= PCB layout is that the silkscreen for the C105, C106 and C107 electrolytic capacitors have been corrected.
